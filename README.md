# final
final project for gray area


# Exploration
From Matt:
1. Random sets of notes (triplets, rests) rather than individual notes
2. Lerp between points on image to move the square -- how does that affect sound
3. Use some sort of histogram algorithm (or something else) in order to get the overall tone of image (or other data).
  a. Explore the image of the data more -- find out how this could influence the sound
4. Maybe another part of image can generate bass line or backing track

1. Find a few images that fit the mood I want. Cycle through them and explore

# Issues
1. IsPlaying() not working on the backing tracks -- probably caused by media event tracking video
